## Overview
This is a portfolio website, this website will display contact details,
links to resume, some blog posts and some information about myself, with the hope to engage clients/potential employers to engauge in utilising my skill set.

## The Purpose
The purpose of my website is to provide clients with a brief overview of my skill set, showcase my design ideas, and offer insight into my interests, hobbies, and personality traits as a dedicated worker. Additionally, it highlights my diverse background across various industries, emphasising my in-depth knowledge and experience, making me a valuable asset to any company.

## Functionality and Features of my website

### Custom Logo
I created a custom logo for the webpage because I firmly believe that unique logos are what sets brands apart. I focused on keeping the design clean and simple, as I believe this is key to making the brand memorable. I utilised this on both the header and the favicon.

### Colour Pallet
My choice of colour pallet was of a more neutral design, clean lines, and basic styling, this is to appeal to a vast range of peoples tastes. The neutral toning helps to highlight the images which create the colour and impact.

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is seamlessly integrated throughout the website, ensuring its constant presence. However, it is designed to be stylish and subtle, rather than bold or domineering, maintaining a quietly neutral presence on all pages.

### Box Shaddows
I incorporated box shadows into my design layout to create a sense of 3D dimension on the pages. This adds depth and provides an engaging layout that entices viewers to click on the boxes and explore the content

### Header
The header must be styled to match the overall look and feel of the website. It should feature a navigation menu with links to other pages. Consistent with the entire website's neutral and warm aesthetic, the header will have an easy-flowing design with ample clean space, avoiding an overwhelming abundance of lines, confusing boxes, colours, popping animations and bold colours.

The Home Landing page is sleek and light, avoiding overwhelming colors that could detract from the site's message.

### Grid Layout
For the grid layout, I adjusted the parameters to ensure a clean, neutral, and professional style. This approach maintains a cohesive look without overwhelming viewers with bold colors and designs.

### Flex Box
Using Flex Box to stylise the desing layout to ensure better functioning resposive web experiences. 

### Portfolio/Services Pages functionality
The portfolio pages are currently non-clickable placeholders, intended to be populated in the future with my actual portfolio designs and completed projects. This section will serve as the showcase for my work.

### Blog Pages functionality
With reference to the blog pages, these have been designed with shaddow boxes, and flexbox, the layout is designed to engage the viewer to click through to enhance usability and feel. 

### Blog Post Selection Landing Page functionality

I implemented a similar format and layout for the blog landing page, mirroring the design of the portfolio page. Additionally, I incorporated bookmarks to enable viewers to easily navigate between different blog posts or return to the top from any point within a post. This feature enhances the viewer's experience by providing seamless navigation and manageability.

### UL and Li
For the footer navigation menu, I utilised unordered lists (UL) to organize the navigation elements. This approach provides a more seamless structure and design, ensuring consistency and ease of navigation for every page.

### Footer
The footer contains crucial information such as contact details, address, phone number, and email contact. However, I made the strategic decision to relocate the social media icons from the footer to the header, positioning them near the logo. This arrangement ensures their constant visibility, encouraging people to reach out and contact me directly through various social media platforms.


### Contact
The Contact form was designed to facilitate direct email communication with clients, allowing them to send their inquiries along with a brief message description. The form's design maintains a professional, sleek, and neutral aesthetic, avoiding overwhelming colors, styles, or animations. This approach ensures a clean and straightforward user experience focused on effective communication.

### About
The About Me landing page features a concise description of myself, complemented by links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Facebook profiles conveniently located in the top right corner for easy access. Additionally, a link to my resume is included in the bottom navigation bar, along with a direct link to the Contact page, where visitors can fill out the email contact form. This setup ensures seamless navigation and access to relevant information for visitors interested in learning more about me and my work.

### Target Audience
My ideal target audience comprises potential employers seeking skilled professionals and clients in need of website design services.
